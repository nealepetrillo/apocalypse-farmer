This page is intended to solidify the concept of the game, gameplay ideas, and other general thoughts about the game.


= Details =

This game is to be based of off the one featured here: 
http://www.arcadetown.com/3rdworldfarmer/gameonline.asp

The concept thus far is after World War Six the Earth has been all but made uninhabitable. You are the leader of a village that must now attempt to rebuild civilization by any means possible. To that end, you can grow food, build infrastructure, and invade neighboring villages. The game play will be similar to 3rd World Farmer such that it is turned based (you plant crops, push a button, and the outcome appears)and expands on the idea by allowing you to send a force to take over a neighboring off screen village. 

The idea thus far is to select a number of people from your village to go and invade; if your force is large enough you win and gain control of that community. Winning the game will consist of controlling the entire arena. 

It may be beneficial to include some sort of macro command wherein you can have 10 rows of corn planted every cycle in a certain village. 

Please add to this Wiki with ideas so we can get a good idea of what we're going to be doing. Also, make sure you document any changes you make to this page in the "commit log" box. We need to have a record of what's going on.
